# Miscellaneous_Robots_SK
A modification of the original Misc. Robots by Haplo to use with Hardcore-SK
it requires the main mod to work, included in HCSK.

You can find the original mod and its modules at

Good things:
- Since Haplo modified the assembly in many different ways for a17, all Bots perform alot smoother and have almost zero impact in game performance. In the future may look into using the xtension tool.

known issues:
- Bots seem generally weaker and slower (workspeed) than before since the a17 update to the code, this is likely due to the fact they are no longer considered colonists in disguise, but rather tamed animals of sorts. Altering their intelligence didnt seem to impact it at all.

- This issue with character capabilities also has the side-effect of rendering the H-K unit broken for the moment.
For now Bots are undraftable and thus are not able to go equip weapons and such, its still possible to perhaps modify it to be a solely melee bot, if melee hunting ever comes back, then can potentially turn it into a hunting job bot. For now its commented out in the code.
